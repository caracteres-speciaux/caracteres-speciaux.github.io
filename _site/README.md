### Generating new frontend template
- npm install -g gulp-cli
- npm install
- gulp
- gulp build for production

Templates and assets for production are generated at the folder root. They won't contain any liquid markup necessary for Jekyll build. If you want to add new template to Weswap's website, you must integrate liquid markups and move the .html into '_layouts' folder.

### Running Jekyll for the blog section
After downloading Weswap's repo, run inside the folder:
- gem install bundler jekyll
- bundle exec jekyll serve
=> Now browse to http://localhost:4000
